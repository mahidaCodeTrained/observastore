Observastore is built to ensure that they have what they need when they come to purchase on the site.

- The project is extensive this README.md file will go through the process of creating Observastore from the business models, development approaches, features, tools and technologies, testing and more. As shopping at Observastore wishes to unlock your eyes to observe the night skies we will observe just how this e-commerce project Observastore came to be.

## Agile Development

## CRUD Functionality

*CRUD* functionality has been implemented throughout the project from when the user wants to read an about page or read the FAQ's which are built in the backend and are being delivered to the frontend for the user to read. CRUD Functionality additionaly exists when a user would like to add a product into their shopping bag where they can update the quantity of that product... all while being able to delete the product from their bag if it no longer peeks their interest to purchase. It is paramount that CRUD functionality was at the forefront of development for this project. The site user must be able to interact with a site to keep them engaged. This is why there are many options for users to submit forms for newsletters, profile or for a contact request. The CRUD functionality also exists for the superuser admin. 

Admin (Superuser only)
- *C*: Create new users, products, FAQ'S, about page statements.
- *R*: Read all of the entries in form data in the django admin.
- *U*: Update products and also update their quantity.
- *D*: Delete products, users.

Dashboard (Site Users)
- *C*: Create their own shopping bag by adding products into it for purchase
- *R*: View the about page and FAQ'S and the products that are listed which leads to their product details page.
- *U*: Users can update the quantity in their shopping bag and also update their profile details (if logged in user)
- *D*: Users can delete their profile information in their profile form, they can delete the products from their shopping bag.


## Design 
- The design of this website takes some inspiration from Code Institute's 'Boutqiue Ado' project. However, there are a plethora of customisations from that which gives Observastore its own unique feel. The visuals of the site follow a very dark space esque theme truly vitalising the colors of white and black and spacegray. The design choice was vital to give the functionality of the ecommerce site it's own space like feel.
- The design of the site lets users flow across the site seemlessly going from one page to another having the feel of being in an online store that is built for their needs which is for enjoyers of the constellations. There are visuals on pages that include images so the user always has something relevant to look at to keep them engaged.
- The design of the checkout and profile in this project do take alot of inspiration from Boutique Ado... its clean, minimilistic and its true goal is to get the site user to the end goal which is completing their purchase.

## Wireframes

- The initial wireframe of Observastore is alot different to what it is now. It's come a long way in terms of its scope. The wireframes are not as detailed and are what they are meant to be.. just initial mockups of how the site is to look and work. The wireframes that I created are descriptive in their nature as instead of focusing solely on how the site is to look. I wanted to envision what the site could become.

## Features 
- Observastore being a e-commerce store is hailed by a plethora of features for the user to enjoy and for the user to experience. The site is fully interactive where the choices of the user will set their destinations on the site with links leading to new pages such as from the initial landing page the navigation is there for the user to go in any direction they want if that is straight to the products page or if they want to login or register first, or perhaps check the FAQS or check the about page to learn more about Observastore.

- We will dive into the vast number of functions that are in place at Observastore for the user to enjoy their experience from links... buttons.... prompts and more.

### Future Features

- Observastore seeks to go beyond in the future... there are more features that can be implemented that were in the pipeline but did not make the intial project. 
- One of these features are a repair service where the user can book in a repair slot for the store which is actually based on a fictional observatory called Observaverse made by me.
- Another feature is the inclusion of a rental service... to rent out a high grade telescope for a certain select amount of days.
